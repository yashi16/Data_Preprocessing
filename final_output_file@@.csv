control,the water is splashing onto the floor.
control,that's it.
control,she's wearing an apron.
control,water is pouring out of the sink.
control,the boy is taking cookies from the cookie jar.
control,and his sister or young girl is asking for some for her.
control,the lid is off the cookie jar.
control,the cupboard door is open.

control,there's a walk.
control,there are two cups on the uh sink counter.
control,there's a plate there.
control,and as I said the water is overflowing.
control,it is already on the floor.
control,there are cupboards above the kitchen counter and below.
control,and the window is above the kitchen sink.
control,"and the mother has a short sleeve dress on has short hair and is drying,the dishes by hand."
control,"curtains on the window that you can see outside the window to the other,side of the house."
control,you can see the grass.
control,you can see the handles on the cupboards.
control,anything else ?
control,the woman is drying the dishes and the w sink is overflowing.
control,the boy's getting the cookies out of the cookie jar.
control,and the stool's about to tip over.
control,and the girl's telling him to be quiet .
control,uh it's a warm sunny day because the window is open.
control,"and she looks like she's sortof in a  in a daze and doesn't quite,know,what's,going,on."
control,"could be daydreaming or daft, one or the other."
control,is that it ?
control,"the boy's falling off a stool after trying to steal cookies,out,of,a,cookie,jar."
control,gonna  give them to his sister.
control,the mother is washing dishes.
control,the water's running on the floor.
control,window's open.
control,the water's running.
control,can't think of anything uh  ...
control,they're in the kitchen.
control,the little girl's whispering or motioning to be quiet.
control,I guess that's it.
control,"and the boy is reaching for cookies and he's falling,off,the,chair,."
control,and the little girl's laughing at him of  I think.
control,and the water's spilling over onto the floor.
control,.
control,.. I can't see any other action.
control,. I guess she's drying her dishes not washing them.
control,she's doing something with them.
control,the little boy is climbing up in the  getting cookies out of the cookie jar and is  he's falling.
control,the stool's falling over.
control,and the little girl has her hand up that she wants a cookie and he's trying to hand her one.
control,and the door to the cabinet is open.
control,and the mother is washing dishes.
control,"and the  dishwash the dish water is overflowing in the sink and it's running on to the floor and she's,standing,in,the,water."
control,and there's  she's drying a plate or washing it.
control,whatever.
control,and there's two cups and a plate on the counter top.
control,and it looks like the window is open.
control,and it has curtains pulled back at the window.
control,and there's a little lane going around the house towards the back I imagine with shrubs.
control,and you can see another window.
control,the little boy is reaching for a cookie.
control,and he's falling at the same time because the stool has tipped over.
control,his little sister is reaching for a cookie and I think beginning to laugh because he's falling.
control,the sink is running over and dripping water on the floor while the mother is trying to dry the dishes.
control,um the window is open and the curtains are blowing in the breeze coming in from outside.
control,the water is running in the sink.
control,that's why it's overflowing.
control,.. I also believe that the mother is daydreaming.
control,. possibly worrying about uh something.
control,that's it.
control,that's all I see.
control,and the water is spilling over the sink onto the floor.
control,"and I see a boy on a stool going for a cookie jar and the stool,is,falling over."
control,"and the girl is putting her finger to her lips and one hand out,to,get a cookie jar."
control,the lady is drying a dish . with a towel.
control,and uh that is all I can see.
control,uh little boy's about to  he's getting into the cookie jar.
control,got up on a stool.
control,"uh handing them off to obviously  well probably his little sister but in the meantime the stool is about to fall over,before,she,really,gets,any."
control,the mother's preoccupied at the sink.
control,she's washing dishes and she's permitting the uh water to over uh overflow.
control,so she herself is starting to stand in a panel    puddle and she seems to be unaware of what's going on behind her.
control,and obviously it's spring or summer because the plants are blooming outside through the uh kitchen window.
control,uh you didn't say what's wrong.
control,I mean this is what I'm supposed to be picking out.
control,uh that's about it.
control,the water's going all over the floor.
control,"here the boy  the step ladder   is turning under his legs and he's stealing cookies,out,of,the,cookie,jar."
control,and she's begging for cookies the girl is.
control,coming back to the sink let's see here.

control,hm ...  let's see.
control,I don't see anything else there.
control,she's stepping in the water.
control,the sink's running over.
control,.. that spells something down there but I can't see it.
control,so far .
control,and he's on a  a stool that's gonna  fall over while they're stealing cookies.
control,and there's a plate and two cups on the sink and she's got a plate in her hand.

control,looks like a nice day.
control,uh action we're looking for action.
control,the kitchen stool that Junior's on is about ready to fall over.

control,uh that's all the action I see.
control,"oh uh Sissy is holding her finger up to her mouth like  ""/."
control,""" don't make any noise or mother will turn around."
control,". I  . I've already said he's reaching a cookie to her and going for another one just before the,stool,falls,down."
control,his socks are drooping.

control,"there are two cups and a dish, I presume that's a dish, that are already dry I guess and sitting on,the,side,of,the,sink."
control,uh nicely groomed.
control,nice curtains pulled back.
control,it's apparently summer outside because the window's open and it looks like shrubs are growing.
control,you can see a window in the other part of the house.
control,I presume that's still their house.
control,and there's a driveway bordered with grass.
control,and there's a tree out there somewhere that you can see part of the trunk and part of the foliage.
control,"and uh I see cabinets around the kitchen, other cabinets."
control,and that's about it.

control,and the uh uh curtains seem to be shaking from the . wind and the air that's blowing in.
control,the dishes that she's through . drying are sitting on the sink top.
control,and the little girl's raising her hands for the little boy to hand her a cookie.
control,and he has one cookie in his hand and he's going after another one.
control,uh he's ready to hand her a cookie.
control,mother is uh holding a dish cloth that she's drying the dishes with.
control,she has a platter that she's drying.

control,the water's over flowing.
control,not  do you  more ?
control,is there more ?
control,right there.

control,"and at the same time his sister is asking him for a cookie and in the  in the process his,stool is starting,to,tip,over."
